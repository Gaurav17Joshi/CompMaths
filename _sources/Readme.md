This repository is a host for various algorithms used in Compuational Mathematics. The book will aim to cover the following topics

- [ ] **Numerical Methods**
- [ ] **Monte Carlo Methods** (in prep)
- [ ] **Optimization** (in prep)
- [ ] **Computational Statistics** (in prep)
- [ ] **Mathematical Appendic** (in prep)
- [ ] **Numerical Operators** (in prep)
- [ ] **Fundamental Maths** (in prep)


While this book is primarily on writing and understanding algorithms, it also covers the mathematical background required to understand the algorithms.
