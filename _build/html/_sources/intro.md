Welcome to Random Walks!
I maintain this website primarily for myself, to keep track of the things I study and make them accessible from anywhere in a nice format.
If the website is useful to you, if you have any ideas for improvement, or if you spot any errors, please feel free to <a href="gauravcjoshi17@gmail.com">email me</a>.

:::{note}

Computational Mathematics is getting an upgrade.
This page is in continous development, and new pages, will be updated as and when they are finished.
:::

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.
